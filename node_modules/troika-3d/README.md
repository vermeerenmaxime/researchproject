# Troika 3D

This package provides the ability to create interactive 3D scenes with Troika's declarative framework. It uses [Three.js](https://threejs.org) as its underlying WebGL renderer, giving you access to Three's full set of tools and its excellent community.

## Documentation

See the [Troika 3D Documentation](../../docs/troika-3d/index.md)


## Other Troika 3D-Related Packages

Some of Troika's more advanced 3D tools have been put in separate packages to keep this one as lean as possible. Those include:

- [Troika 3D Text](../troika-3d-text/): high quality antialiased text rendering in WebGL, including a standalone version for using with Three.js outside of Troika
- [Troika 3D UI](../troika-3d-ui): flexbox layout and 2D panel rendering for interactive user interfaces in 3D scenes
- [Troika XR](../troika-xr): WebXR support for Troika 3D scenes
- [Three.js Utils](../troika-three-utils): a collection of utilities for working with Three.js, such as shader manipulation
